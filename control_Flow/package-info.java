/*Java Control Statements | Control Flow in Java

Java compiler executes the code from top to bottom.
 The statements in the code are executed according to the order in which they appear.
  However, Java provides statements that can be used to control the flow of Java code.
   Such statements are called control flow statements. It is one of the fundamental features of Java,
    which provides a smooth flow of program.

Java provides three types of control flow statements.

   1. Decision Making statements
        if statements
        switch statement
   2. Loop statements
        do while loop
        while loop
        for loop
        for-each loop
   3. Jump statements
        break statement
        continue statement

Decision-Making statements:

As the name suggests, decision-making statements decide which statement to execute and when.
 Decision-making statements evaluate the Boolean expression and control the program flow depending upon the result of the condition provided.
  There are two types of decision-making statements in Java, i.e., If statement and switch state
